# Federated Learning Server-Client Application

## Overview

This project consists of two Python scripts:

1. `server.py`: A Python server that handles incoming client requests.
2. `client.py`: A Python client that interacts with the server.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can check by running:

```bash
python --version
```

Install any required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

How to Run
Step 1: Start the Server

```bash
python server.py
```

Step 2: Run the Client
After starting the server, you can run a client. The following command starts the client with a specified client_id and num_clients:

```bash
python client.py --client_id 0 --num_clients 1
```

Here:

--client_id: The ID assigned to the client (in this case, 0).
--num_clients: The total number of clients that will connect to the server (in this case, 1)
